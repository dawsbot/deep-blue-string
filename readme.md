## Usage

```js
const dbs = require('deep-blue-string');

//Sanitize any data type
dbs({userInput: 'DROP TABLE admin'}, String.prototype.replace, ['DROP TABLE', 'not in my house']);
//=> {userInput: 'not in my house admin'}
```

## API

### dbs(target, function, [fnArgs])

##### target

*Required*  
Type: Any  

##### function

*Required*  
Type: `function`

##### fnArgs

*Optional*  
Type: `string` || `array`  
Description: If the user inputted function takes arguments, supply them here. For multiple arguments (like `String.prototype.replace`, input them as an array).
